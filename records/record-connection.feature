Feature: Record Connectivity

  Background:
    Given client A connects and logs into server 1
      And client B connects and logs into server 1
      And client C connects and logs into server 2
      And client D connects and logs into server 3
      And all clients get the record "record"
      And client A sets the record "record" with data '{ "user": { "firstname": "John" } }'

  Scenario: Maintains a local copy of the record
    When client A sets the record "record" and path "user.firstname" with data 'Bob'

    Then all clients have record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'Bob'

    When server 1 goes down
      And server 2 goes down
      And server 3 goes down

    Then all clients have record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'Bob'

    When server 1 comes back up
      And server 2 comes back up
      And server 3 comes back up

    Then all clients receive at least one "CONNECTION" error "CONNECTION_ERROR"
      And all clients have record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'Bob'

  Scenario: Remote wins by default
    When server 1 goes down
      And client A sets the record "record" and path "user.firstname" with data 'Mike'
      And client A sets the record "record" and path "user.firstname" with data 'Mike1'
      And client A sets the record "record" and path "user.firstname" with data 'Mike2'

    Then client A has record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'Mike2'
    Then client B has record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'John'
    Then client C has record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'John'
    Then client D has record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'John'

    When server 1 comes back up

    Then client A receives at least one "CONNECTION" error "CONNECTION_ERROR"
      And client B receives at least one "CONNECTION" error "CONNECTION_ERROR"
      And all clients have record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'Mike2'

  #Flaky test
  #Scenario: Remote wins by default
    #When server 1 goes down
      #And client A sets the record "record" and path "user.firstname" with data 'Mike'
      #And client B sets the record "record" and path "user.firstname" with data 'Sam'

    #Then client A has record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'Mike'
    #Then client B has record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'Sam'
    #Then client C has record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'John'
    #Then client D has record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'John'

    #When server 1 comes back up

    #Then client A receives at least one "CONNECTION" error "CONNECTION_ERROR"
      #And client B receives at least one "CONNECTION" error "CONNECTION_ERROR"
      #And all clients have record "record" with path "user.firstname" and data 'Mike'
